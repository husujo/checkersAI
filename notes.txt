improve checkers:
	each piece keeps track of it's last move, don't move back and forth
	use fractions to determine value, not raw count. aka, having 1 extra piece is 50% better for you, not simply +10
	aka, trade pieces when you are up

	
white+white+whitek+whitek = 60
vs	(value=20)					=> 60/40 = 1.5
red+red+redk		=  40

white+white+whitek		=  40
vs	(value = 20)					=> 40/20 = 2
red+red			=  20



TODO*** put in something that lets you start a game from a predefined position

ideas:
have the getValue function set all the moves' values, even if they are unneeded.
to choose the best one, have a seperate function to loop through the current moves we have, and choose the best one.
